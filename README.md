# About Me:

ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Shreyash, a passionate Computer Science and Engineering student currently pursuing my bachelor's degree. I specialize in Front-End Web Development and am enthusiastic about contributing to open-source projects.

ðŸŒŒ Beyond the world of technology, I have a profound interest in space-related topics. Exploring the mysteries of the universe always fascinates me, and I enjoy staying updated with the latest developments in space exploration.

ðŸŽ® In addition to web development and space exploration, I dabble in game development using Unity Game Engine. Creating immersive experiences and exploring the possibilities of interactive storytelling through games is a hobby I thoroughly enjoy.
